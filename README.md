## 📌 Problem Statement

**Identify high-potential regions and strategies for launching an electric vehicle (EV) business in India using data-driven market segmentation and sales forecasting.**

---

## 🧠 Background

India’s EV market is rapidly growing due to environmental concerns, rising fuel prices, and government incentives. However, regional disparities in EV infrastructure, policy, and demand make it challenging for startups to decide where and how to launch. This project uses machine learning and visualization to uncover actionable insights for EV adoption strategy.

## ✅ Project Outcomes

- 🔹 **Segmented the Indian EV market** into high-growth, mid-tier, and low-adoption clusters using K-Means.
- 🔹 **Forecasted future sales trends** with Exponential Smoothing, highlighting states with the most growth potential.
- 🔹 **Identified key sales drivers** (region, vehicle type, etc.) using a Random Forest Regressor.
- 🔹 **Detected anomalies in EV sales** using Isolation Forest to uncover unusual demand patterns.
- 🔹 **Built a Policy Impact Simulator** to visualize the effect of subsidies, petrol prices, and infra growth on projected EV sales.
- 🔹 **Developed a full-featured Streamlit dashboard** for interactive EDA, modeling, and simulation.
